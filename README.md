This project involves developing a real-time malware detection Android app using a TensorFlow Lite model and a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) algorithm. APK files are collected, with key features like permissions and intents extracted and selected using SelectKBest. The FNN-based model classifies apps as benign or malicious, and the optimized TensorFlow Lite version is integrated into Android Studio. The app features real-time and offline scanning capabilities, ensuring efficient performance and resource usage across various Android devices.
